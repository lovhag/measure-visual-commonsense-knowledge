# Visual Property Norms Results

This folder should contain Visual Property Norms results. Especially, it should contain the `results.csv` file generated from running [generate-results.ipynb](../../generate-results.ipynb) with pre-trained model weights, or from [downloading the results](https://chalmers-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/lovhag_chalmers_se/EgIEsHUixuZPnJHV7lLCMQ4BFNisHKkKQxpijUOuKvZS9A?e=gRFhdn).
